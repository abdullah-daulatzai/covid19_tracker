# Covid-19 Tracker
Welcome to the Covid18 tracker README! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the app.
## Overview 
The Covid-19 Tracker is an app that gives you a quick look at the Covid-19 numbers around the world. It shows how many people have caught the virus, how many have died, and how many have recovered, using data from a public API. The app also has charts to help you see the impact of the pandemic, including how many people have been affected and the death rate. This helps users stay updated with the latest Covid-19 information worldwide.

The app gets real-time data from a free, publicly available API and is designed to be a simple tool for anyone who wants to follow the progress of the pandemic.

## Features
* Real-time tracking of global Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
* Interactive charts powered by Chart.js to visualize the number of cases and deaths.
* View daily, total, and recovered cases in a clear and concise format.
* Dynamic updates using data from a public Covid-19 API.
* Mobile-friendly design, ensuring easy access from any device.

## Tech Stack
* Frontend: React, JavaScript, CSS, Material UI
* Charting: Chart.js
* Other Technologies: React hooks, Axios (for API calls)
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
